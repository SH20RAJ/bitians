## 🎯 K-Batch System Deep Dive

### **Batch Calculation Logic**
```javascript
// Current year: 2024
// K24 = Admitted in 2024 (1st Year)
// K23 = Admitted in 2023 (2nd Year)
// K22 = Admitted in 2022 (3rd Year)
// K21 = Admitted in 2021 (4th Year)

const getKBatch = (admissionYear) => {
  return `K${admissionYear.toString().slice(-2)}`;
};

const getCurrentYear = (kBatch) => {
  const admissionYear = parseInt(`20${kBatch.slice(1)}`);
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  return currentYear - admissionYear + 1;
};
```

### **Badge Color System**
- **K24 (1st Year)**: Fresh Green (#10B981) - New beginnings
- **K23 (2nd Year)**: Ocean Blue (#3B82F6) - Growing confidence  
- **K22 (3rd Year)**: Royal Purple (#8B5CF6) - Gaining expertise
- **K21 (4th Year)**: Golden Orange (#F59E0B) - Senior wisdom

### **Batch-Specific Features**
- **Content Filtering**: Filter posts by specific K-batches
- **Mentorship Programs**: Connect juniors with seniors
- **Placement Updates**: Year-specific career guidance
- **Academic Resources**: Semester-appropriate study materials

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### **Code Style**
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Comment complex logic and algorithms

### **Component Structure**
```javascript
// Component template
"use client";

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { ComponentUI } from "@/components/ui/Component";
import { useTheme } from "@/components/ThemeProvider";

export default function ComponentName() {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

  // Component logic here

  return (
    <div className="component-container">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **Hashtag Implementation**
```javascript
// Hashtag parsing function
const parseHashtags = (text) => {
  const hashtagRegex = /#[a-zA-Z0-9_]+/g;
  return text.replace(hashtagRegex, (match) => 
    `<a href="/hashtags/${match.slice(1)}" class="hashtag-link">${match}</a>`
  );
};
```

### **Mention Implementation**
```javascript
// Mention parsing function
const parseMentions = (text) => {
  const mentionRegex = /@[a-zA-Z0-9_]+/g;
  return text.replace(mentionRegex, (match) =>
    `<a href="/profile/${match.slice(1)}" class="mention-link">${match}</a>`
  );
};
```
