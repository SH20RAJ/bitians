Here’s a curated list of **top UI/UX principles and laws** that are widely accepted and applied in user-centered design:

## 🎯 **Top UI/UX Principles**

1. **User-Centric Design**

   * Design for the user's needs, behaviors, and limitations.
   * Prioritize usability and user satisfaction.

2. **Consistency**

   * Keep elements, layouts, colors, and interactions predictable across the product.

3. **Simplicity**

   * Aim for minimalism: fewer steps, clear visuals, and no unnecessary elements.

4. **Visual Hierarchy**

   * Use size, color, contrast, and spacing to guide the user's attention.

5. **Feedback and Response**

   * Provide clear feedback for user actions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).

6. **Accessibility**

   * Design for everyone, including users with disabilities (color contrast, keyboard navigation, alt texts).

7. **Mobile-First Design**

   * Start with the smallest screen and progressively enhance for larger devices.

8. **Affordance**

   * Elements should visually indicate how they are to be used (e.g., buttons look clickable).

9. **Contextual Design**

   * Consider the user’s environment, device, and situation while using the product.

10. **Loading Time Optimization**

* Speed is critical; slow interfaces lead to user frustration.

## ⚖️ **Key UX Laws**

### 1. **Hick’s Law**

The more choices you offer, the longer it takes for users to make a decision.
👉 *Keep it simple.*

### 2. **Fitts’s Law**

The time to reach a target depends on the size and distance of the target.
👉 *Make important buttons large and easy to reach.*

### 3. **Jakob’s Law**

Users prefer your product to work the same way as the other products they already know.
👉 *Follow common patterns and conventions.*

### 4. **Miller’s Law**

The average person can hold about 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
👉 *Don’t overload the user with information.*

### 5. **Law of Proximity**

Objects that are close to each other are perceived as a group.
👉 *Use spacing to group related elements.*

### 6. **Law of Similarity**

Users group similar-looking elements together.
👉 *Use consistent colors, shapes, and sizes to indicate similarity.*

### 7. **Tesler’s Law (Law of Conservation of Complexity)**

Some complexity in a system is unavoidable. The designer should reduce it from the user’s side.
👉 *Handle complexity in the backend.*

### 8. **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**

Users perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as more usable.
👉 *Good-looking products feel easier to use.*

### 9. **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**

80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
👉 *Focus on the 20% of features that deliver 80% of the value.*

### 10. **Serial Position Effect**

People best remember the first and last items in a list.
👉 *Place critical information at the beginning or end.*
